# midpoint-clicker

This is a tiny toy for experimenting with recursive point sets.

* Click to add a new point.
* Press space to add the average of each point pair to the point set.

Nearby points are automatically merged to put a minor dampener on the combinatorial explosion. Some other performance considerations were made but it is what it is.
